        <p><strong>Participant 1 (Health Professional)</strong>: A critical aspect is educating the public about the signs of mental illness and where to get help. We could partner with schools, workplaces, and local communities to conduct workshops.</p>

        <p><strong>Participant 2 (Social Media Manager)</strong>: Absolutely! Social media is powerful for this. We can create relatable contentâ€”personal stories, expert advice, and myth-busting infographics. A hashtag campaign, like #BreakTheSilence, could encourage people to share their experiences.</p>

        <p><strong>Participant 3 (Community Leader)</strong>: We also need to focus on accessibility. Not everyone is online or comfortable talking about mental health publicly. Hosting local events, support groups, and anonymous helplines might reach people who feel isolated.</p>
